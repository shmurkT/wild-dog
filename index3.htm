			African wild dogs are highly efficient and cooperative hunters, employing a unique hunting strategy that sets them apart from other carnivores. Their diet primarily consists of medium-sized ungulates, such as impalas and gazelles, but they are known to target larger prey like wildebeests and smaller mammals like rodents when necessary. Unlike many other carnivores, African wild dogs are endurance runners, capable of covering large distances during hunts. Their remarkable stamina allows them to pursue prey for extended periods, often wearing down the target until it succumbs to exhaustion.<br></p>

			<p style="background-color:DarkGoldenRod;font-size:25px;text-indent: 5em; color:white;">Hunting in packs, African wild dogs showcase remarkable cooperation and communication. The pack, led by an alpha pair, works together to strategize and execute a successful hunt. The dogs are known for their distinctive, mottled coat patterns, which not only serve as unique identifiers but also aid in camouflage during the chase. Their cooperative hunting style involves effective communication through vocalizations, body language, and a distinctive sneezing-like sound that helps coordinate the pack during the hunt.<br></p>

			<p style="background-color: DarkGoldenRod;font-size:25px;text-indent: 5em;color:white;">Once a prey animal is targeted, the pack collaborates to surround and isolate it. Working together, they take turns chasing the prey at high speeds, utilizing their endurance to outlast the quarry. African wild dogs are known for their remarkable success rates in hunts, with studies suggesting that they achieve a higher percentage of successful kills compared to many other carnivores. This efficiency is crucial for the survival of the pack, especially since African wild dogs have relatively large territories and need substantial amounts of food to sustain their energetic lifestyles.</p>
